and stay hateful through the exchange of quick, malicious answers to
one simple question: <b>What do you hate?</b>',
:home_why => "Why? Because even basic hate can be hurtful to family members,
friends, and colleagues—especially when it's personal and unnecessary.<ul>
<li><b>Eating soup?</b> Only old dusty motherfuckers with no teeth eat soup</li>
<li><b>Running late to a meeting?</b> I guess you'll be late making those fries too</li>
<li><b>Partying?</b> You've never been invited to a party—stop lying</li></ul>",
:home_how => "With h8ter, you can hate on your friends and always know what
they're hating on. Or, you can stop hating on them when hell freezes
over. You can even set quiet times on h8ter so people can hate behind your back.
<br /><br /><b>h8ter puts you in control</b> and becomes a modern antidote to people
having so much more than you.",
